## [Dragon Seeking Dungeon](https://dragon-seeking-dungeon.herokuapp.com/)

Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game; a group of players create a story (called a campaign) together using dice rolls to determine their fate. It's a lot of fun but it can also be hard to find a group of like-minded people to play with. This is where **Dragon Seeking Dungeon** comes in!

I'm working on adding automated emailing with Action Mailer to send emails to all players in a full campaign a message that will connect them so they can begin organizing their game.

Additionally I want to add the ability to search campaigns by timezone/city.

There are a few styling tweaks I would like to implement as well, including improving font choices and responsiveness. Also there's a common problem with Bootstrap 4 cards that I'm still working through.
